Exodus databases
================

Analysis data from unstructured finite element or finite volume models are accessed through the *Exodus II* library. The
exodus module provides a Python interface for input and output of Exodus II databases.

    Exodus II is a model developed to store and retrieve data for finite element analyses. It is used for preprocessing
    (problem definition), postprocessing (results visualization), as well as code to code data transfer.
    An Exodus II data file is a random access, machine independent, binary file. The ExodusII file format and API is
    based on the NetCDF and HDF5 formats and API's, respectively.


Variables are scalars, or the components of the components of fields.
